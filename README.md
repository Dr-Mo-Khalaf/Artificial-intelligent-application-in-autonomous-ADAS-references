# Artificial-intelligent-application-in-autonomous-ADAS-references
Autonomous Driving Systems (ADAS) are rapidly evolving, thanks to advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). These systems use a combination of sensors, actuators, and AI algorithms to enable vehicles to operate with minimal human intervention. This repository serves as a centralized hub for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts interested in the intersection of AI and ADAS.
Key Areas of Focus

# Perception:

## Sensor Fusion: ## 
Combining data from various sensors (cameras, LiDAR, radar) for a more comprehensive understanding of the environment.
Object Detection and Tracking: Identifying and tracking objects (vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs) in real-time.
Semantic Segmentation: Assigning labels (e.g., road, sidewalk, sky) to pixels in an image.
# Prediction: #

## Motion Planning: ##
Determining the optimal path for the vehicle to follow based on the environment and goals.
Behavior Prediction: Anticipating the actions of other road users (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles) to avoid collisions.
Decision Making:

## Ethical AI: ##
Developing algorithms that can make morally sound decisions in complex scenarios.
Risk Assessment: Evaluating the potential risks associated with different actions.
# Learning and Adaptation: #

## Reinforcement Learning: ## 
Training AI agents to make decisions through trial and error.
## Transfer Learning: ## 
Leveraging knowledge from one task to improve performance on another.
